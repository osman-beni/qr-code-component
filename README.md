- [Duck Ai](https://duck.ai) - I had some misunderstanding with how the layers feature in css worked. It helped understand a little better.
- [CSS in Depth](https://www.manning.com/books/css-in-depth-second-edition) - This is an amazing book which helped me understand a lot about CSS. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning CSS.
